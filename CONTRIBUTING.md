# Contributors Guide

Want to help build pylook? Have an improvement, a bug report/fix, or a new feature? We're happy to help you get setup to contribute! This guide will get your development environment setup and go over how to contribute to pylook.

## Welcome
We're excited that you are considering contributing to pylook. This is a community-driven project are it takes people like you to keep it active. You can spend 2 minutes filing a bug report or 2 days creating a new feature - we're grateful either way!

Please take a few minutes to read through this guide on how to contribute. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests.

## But I'm No Coder
And we are 100% okay with that! Everyone starts somewhere and we realize that few of us have days jobs as software developers. No matter who you are or what your role is, you can make a contribution! We'll help you along the way. Yes, there is a lot of jargon in the software world and some processes seem burdensome, but they are there for a reason - often through a hard spot we encountered as developers!

## What Can I Do?
* Tackle an [issue](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/pylook/issues)
* Submit a bug report or feature request as an [issue](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/pylook/issues)
* Make an example, tutorial, or help improve documentation
* Create a new feature

## Ground Rules
The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone. Please
be considerate and respectful of others by following our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/pylook/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Other items:

* Each pull request should consist of a logical collection of changes. You can
  include multiple bug fixes in a single pull request, but they should be related.
  For unrelated changes, please submit multiple pull requests.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix
  (eg: .gitignore).
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code; we don't want
  to break other users' code, so care must be taken not to introduce bugs.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is
  generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* Function arguments:
  - Use full names for parameters rather than symbols (e.g. temperature instead of t)

## Reporting a bug
The easiest way to get involved is to report issues you encounter when using pylook or by
requesting something you think is missing.

* Head over to the [issues](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/pylook/issues) page.
* Search to see if your issue already exists or has even been solved previously.
* If you indeed have a new issue or request, click the "New Issue" button.
* Fill in as much of the issue template as is relevant. Please be as specific as possible.
  Include the version of the code you were using, as well as what operating system you
  are running. If possible, include complete, minimal example code that reproduces the problem.

## Setting up your development environment
We recommend using the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager for your Python
environments. Our recommended setup for contributing is:

* Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) on your system.
* Install git on your system if it is not already there (install XCode command line tools on a Mac or git bash on Windows)
* Login to your GitHub account and make a fork of the [pylook repository](https://github.com/LeemanGeophysicalLLC/pylook) by clicking the "Fork" button.
* Clone your fork of the pylook repository (in terminal on Mac/Linux or git shell/
  GUI on Windows) in the location you'd like to keep it. We are partial to creating a
  ``git_repos`` directory in our home folder.
  ``git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/pylook.git``
* Navigate to that folder in the terminal or in Anaconda Prompt if you're on Windows.
  ``cd pylook``
* Connect your repository to the upstream (main project).
  ``git remote add lgeo https://github.com/leemangeophysicalllc/pylook.git``
* Create the development environment by running ``conda env create``. This will install
  all of the packages in the ``environment.yml`` file.
* Activate our new development environment ``activate pylook``.
* Make an editable install of pylook by running ``pip install -e .``

Now you're all set! You have an environment called ``pylook`` that you can work in. You'll need to make sure to activate that environment next time you want to use it after closing the
terminal or your system. If you want to get back to the root environment, just run
``deactivate``.

## Pull Requests

The changes to the MetPy source (and documentation) should be made via GitHub pull requests
against ``master``, even for those with administration rights. While it's tempting to
make changes directly to ``master`` and push them up, it is better to make a pull request so
that others can give feedback. If nothing else, this gives a chance for the automated tests to
run on the PR. This can eliminate "brown paper bag" moments with buggy commits on the master
branch.

During the Pull Request process, before the final merge, it's a good idea to rebase the branch
and squash together smaller commits. It's not necessary to flatten the entire branch, but it
can be nice to eliminate small fixes and get the merge down to logically arranged commits. This
can also be used to hide sins from history--this is the only chance, since once it hits
``master``, it's there forever!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* video series
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github), Aaron Meurer's [tutorial on the git workflow](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/), or the guide [â€œHow to Contribute to Open Source"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

Commit the changes you made. Chris Beams has written a [guide](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write good commit messages.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request]( https://github.com/leemangeophysicalllc/pylook/compare/).
For the Pull Request to be accepted, you need to agree to the
pylook Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This will be handled automatically
upon submission of a Pull Request.
See [here](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/master/CLA.md) for more
explanation and rationale behind the CLA.

## Source Code
The source code is located in the `pylook/` directory in the root of the repository. Inside here
are the main top-level subpackages of pylook:
- `calc`: Calculations and tools
- `io`: Tools for reading and writing files
- `plots`: Plotting tools using Matplotlib (and Cartopy)

## Documentation
Now that you've made your awesome contribution, it's time to tell the world how to use it.
Writing documentation strings is really important to make sure others use your functionality
properly. Didn't write new functions? That's fine, but be sure that the documentation for
the code you touched is still in great shape. It is not uncommon to find some strange wording
or clarification that you can take care of while you are here.

You can write examples in the documentation if they are simple concepts to demonstrate. If
your feature is more complex, consider adding to the examples or tutorials.

You can build the documentation locally to see how your changes will look.
* Navigate to the docs folder ``cd docs``
* Remove any old builds and build the current docs ``make clean html``
* Open ``docs/build/html/index.html`` and see your changes!

## Tests
Unit tests are the lifeblood of the project, as it ensures that we can continue to add and
change the code and stay confident that things have not broken. Running the tests requires
``pytest``, which is easily available through ``conda`` or ``pip``. It was also installed if
you made our default ``pylook`` environment.

### Running Tests
Running the tests can be done by running ``pytest``

Running the whole test suite isn't that slow, but can be a burden if you're working on just
one module or a specific test. It is easy to run tests on a single directory:

```sh
pytest tests/calc
```

A specific test can be run as:

```sh
pytest -k test_my_test_func_name
```

### Writing Tests
Tests should ideally hit all of the lines of code added or changed. We have automated
services that can help track down lines of code that are missed by tests. Watching the
coverage has even helped find sections of dead code that could be removed!

Let's say we are adding a simple function to add two numbers and return the result as a float
or as a string. (This would be a silly function, but go with us here for demonstration
purposes.)

```python
def add_as_float_or_string(a, b, as_string=False):
    res = a + b
    if as_string:
       return string(res)
    return res
```

I can see two easy tests here: one for the results as a float and one for the results as a
string. If I had added this to the ``calc`` module, I'd add those two tests in
``tests/calc/test_calc.py``.

```python
def test_add_as_float_or_string_defaults():
    res = add_as_float_or_string(3, 4)
    assert(res, 7)


def test_add_as_float_or_string_string_return():
    res = add_as_float_or_string(3, 4, as_string=True)
    assert(res, '7')
```

There are plenty of more advanced testing concepts, like dealing with floating point
comparisons, parameterizing tests, testing that exceptions are raised, and more. Have a look
at the existing tests to get an idea of some of the common patterns.

### Image tests
Some tests (for matplotlib plotting code) are done as an image comparison, using the
pytest-mpl plugin. To run these tests, use:

```sh
pytest --mpl
````

When adding new image comparison tests, start by creating the baseline images for the tests:

```sh
pytest --mpl-generate-path=baseline
```

That command runs the tests and saves the images in the ``baseline`` directory.
For MetPy this is generally ``tests/plots/baseline/``. We recommend using the ``-k`` flag
to run only the test you just created for this step.

For more information, see the [docs for pytest-mpl](https://github.com/astrofrog/pytest-mpl).


## Cached Data Files
MetPy keeps some test data in a data cache supported by the pooch library. To add files to
this, please ensure they are as small as possible. Put the files in the `staticdata` directory.
Then run this command in the pylook directory (that contains the `static-data-manifest.txt`
file)to recreate the data registry:

```sh
python -c "import pooch; pooch.make_registry('staticdata', 'pylook/static-data-manifest.txt')"
```

Make sure that no system files (like `.DS_Store`) are in the manifest and add it to your
contribution.

## Code Style
pylook uses the Python code style outlined in [PEP8](https://pep8.org). For better or worse, this
is what the majority of the Python world uses. The one deviation is that line length limit is
95 characters. 80 is a good target, but some times longer lines are needed.

While the authors are no fans of blind adherence to style and so-called project "clean-ups"
that go through and correct code style, pylook has adopted this style from the outset.
Therefore, it makes sense to enforce this style as code is added to keep everything clean and
uniform. To this end, part of the automated testing for pylook checks style. To check style
locally within the source directory you can use the ``flake8`` tool. Running it
from the root of the source directory is as easy as running ``pytest --flake8`` in the base
of the repository.

You can also just submit your PR and the kind robots will comment on all style violations as
well. It can be a pain to make sure you have the right number of spaces around things, imports
in order, and all of the other nits that the bots will find. It is very important though as
this consistent style helps us keep MetPy readable, maintainable, and uniform.

## What happens after the pull request
You've make your changes, documented them, added some tests, and submitted a pull request.
What now?

### Automated Testing
First, our army of never sleeping robots will begin a series of automated checks.
The test suite, documentation, style, and more will be checked on various versions of Python
with current and legacy packages. Other services will kick in and check if there is a drop in
code coverage or any style variations that should be corrected. If you see a red mark by a
service, something failed and clicking the "Details" link will give you more information.
We're happy to help if you are stuck.

The robots can be difficult to satisfy, but they are there to help everyone write better code.
In some cases, there will be exceptions to their suggestions, but these are rare. If you make
changes to your code and push again, the tests will automatically run again.

### Code Review
At this point you're waiting on us. You should expect to hear at least a comment within a
couple of days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted quickly:

* Write tests.
* Follow [PEP8](https://pep8.org) for style. (The `flake8` utility can help with this.)
* Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Pull requests will automatically have tests run by Travis. This includes
running both the unit tests as well as the `flake8` code linter.

### Merging
Once we're all happy with the pull request, it's time for it to get merged in. Only the
maintainers can merge pull requests and you should never merge a pull request you have commits
on as it circumvents the code review. If this is your first or second pull request, we'll
likely help by rebasing and cleaning up the commit history for you. As your development skills
increase, we'll help you learn how to do this.
